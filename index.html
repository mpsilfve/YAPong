     You control the paddle on the left using the up and down arrow keys.
     The computer will control the paddle on the right. Happy playing :)</p>

   <p>The project was inspired by Eisenfunk's
     <a href='https://youtu.be/cNAdtkSjSps'>Pong music video</a> and my need
     to learn JS. The <a href="https://github.com/mpsilfve/YAPong/tree/main">source
